Datalinks 2.0
===================


Introduction:
-------------
Datalinks is a web-based application for storing a collection of links (bookmarks), written in PHP. It allows you to
store all your bookmarks in one place and access them in the same way, regardless if you work on your home computer,
at school, at work, or in an Internet cafe. Links are assigned to categories, which can be arranged in a tree hierarchy.
Information about links and categories is stored in two tables in a MySQL database.

Through index.php page you can add, edit and delete both categories and links, and you can move links and categories
from one category to another. Most of these actions are done through an AJAX request and do not require reloading of the
page. To make any changes in the database you have to log in. You can also search the database for links and categories
containing a given phrase (this doesn't require logging in).

Normal categories use a blue folder icon and are visible for all visitors. If you want to hide some links, you can use
one of two other kinds of categories: private (red) are visible on the lists, but regular users can't see their
contents, while hidden (grey) aren't shown anywhere at all. Links and categories assigned to private or hidden
categories (and their subcategories, and sub-subcategories, etc.) also don't show up on the search results page.

When you delete a category, by default all links from that category and its subcategories aren't deleted, but are moved
to its parent category. If you want to remove them together with the category, select the "Delete links too" option.

If you want to change your password or other settings after installation, you can do that by editing config.php file.


Requirements:
-------------
* WWW Server (e.g. Apache) with PHP and MySQL PHP module (tested with Apache 2.0.54 + PHP 4.3.10, should work with later
versions, maybe with some earlier too)
* MySQL database (not necessarily on the same server) - tested with v. 4.1.11, should work with later versions

Datalinks has been tested in Firefox 2, IE 6 and 7, and Opera 9.


Installation:
-------------

Installation should be pretty simple. First, unpack all files to a chosen directory. Make sure that the config.php file
is writable for PHP scripts (you may need to give full permissions to it to all users, just for the installation). Then
open install/install.php in a browser, fill all the fields in the form and click "Install". The script should create two
tables, one for categories and one for links, put one category (the root category) in the categories table, and update
the config.php file. If everything is OK, a message "Installation successful!" will appear and you will be asked to
delete the "install" directory. Then you can go to index.php, log in using the password you have given during the
installation, and start adding new categories and links.

After the installation is finished, you should also make sure that the config.php file, which stores settings and
database connection data, is not accessible for other users of your server (e.g. on Unix systems set its access rights
to 600 or "rw-------"), unless the Apache server is configured in such a way that the application doesn't work if such
permissions are set.

Alternatively, if you want to create the tables and config file yourself - the table definitions are stored in
doc/tables.sql file.


Troubleshooting:
----------------

* If you get strange HTTP errors like 403 or 500, try changing some access rights to the datalinks directory or to .php
files; if nothing works, consult the admin of your server (unless you're the admin, then you have a problem ;)
* If you get logged out too often, find your main PHP configuration file (php.ini) and increase the session file
lifetime (session.gc_maxlifetime option). Or consult your admin :)


Known issues:
-------------

* Javascript sorts names containing non-ascii letters in a wrong way (MySQL does it right, so reloading the page usually
helps)
* dialogs look bad in Konqueror
